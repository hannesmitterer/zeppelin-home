### üìÅ `file-manager.sh` - Content and Push Management

Manages content updates and git operations:

- **Check git status**
  ```bash

  ```

- **Add media files**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/file-manager.sh add-media /path/to/image.png
  ```

## Usage Examples

### Adding New Content

```bash
# Add a new media file
./scripts/file-manager.sh add-media ~/Downloads/new-banner.png

# Edit your content in docs/
# Then quickly update and deploy
./scripts/file-manager.sh quick "Add new campaign banner"
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Set up development environment
./scripts/deploy.sh install

# Start live development server
./scripts/deploy.sh serve
# Site available at http://localhost:4000
```

### Testing Before Push

```bash
# Test build process
./scripts/deploy.sh test

# Check git status
./scripts/file-manager.sh status

# Push changes
./scripts/file-manager.sh push "Update campaign details"
```

---

## Automated Deployment

When you push to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically:

- Builds the Jekyll site with all dependencies
- Tests the build process for errors
- Deploys to GitHub Pages at [https://hannesmitterer.github.io/zeppelin-home/](https://hannesmitterer.github.io/zeppelin-home/)

The deployment typically takes **2-5 minutes** to complete.

---

## Notes

- Scripts must be run from the repository root directory
- Ruby and Bundler must be installed for Jekyll operations
- All scripts include error checking and colored output for better user experience
- The deploy script validates that all critical files are generated during builds
