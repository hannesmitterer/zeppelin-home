# Automated Deployment ðŸš€

## Overview

The following commands demonstrate a basic Git workflow for continuous deployment of your Jekyll site. After pushing updates to the repository, automated services (like GitHub Pages or a CI/CD pipeline) are typically triggered to build and deploy the site.

## Commands

```bash
# Stage all changes for the next commit
git add .

# Create a new commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Automated Jekyll build and deploy"

# Push the commit to the main branch of the remote repository
git push origin main
```

## What Happens Next?

- **Staging (`git add .`)**: Stages all updated, added, or deleted files for commit. (You can target specific files as needed.)
- **Committing (`git commit -m "..."`)**: Records a snapshot of the staged changes.
- **Pushing (`git push origin main`)**: Transmits your commit to the remote repositoryâ€™s main branch.

Once the changes are pushed, services like **GitHub Pages** or a configured **CI/CD pipeline** (e.g., GitHub Actions) will automatically build and deploy your Jekyll site.

> For advanced workflows, consider integrating automated tests or deployment previews in your pipeline.
